1. Download and install Docker on your system
2. Run: `docker run -it --env-file ./.env --restart unless-stopped --name bing-rewards nelsondane/bing-rewards:<tag>`. This creates a new container called bing-rewards. Make sure you have the correct path to your `.env` file you created.

Let the bot log in, this could take a minute. Make sure the bot logs in correctly: wait until it prints your email and points. DO NOT PRESS CTRL-C. This will kill the container. To exit the logs view, press CTRL-p then CTRL-q. This will exit the logs view but let the bot keep running.
